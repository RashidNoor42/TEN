“Synergize is the habit of creative cooperation. It is teamwork, open-mindedness, <br>and the adventure of finding new solutions to old problems. But it doesn't just happen on its own. It's a process, and through that process, people bring all their personal experience and expertise to the table.” - Stephen R. Covey

<li> provides opportunities for professional networking and leadership.</li> <br>
